# Velocity optimization
Optimizes (Maximizes) the velocity profile for a vehicle respecting physical constraints (e.g., power, force, combined acceleration, ...). Takes into account a variable friction potential between road and tires. Max. power input can be variable (for e.g., energy strategy purpose).
